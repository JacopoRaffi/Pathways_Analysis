# Pathways_Analysis
The final project discussed, related to the "Computational Health Laboratory" examination, consists of the selection and combination of pathways, found on "Reactome", belonging to a subclass of metabolic diseases together with drug interactions obtained from "DrugBank". Through the generation of a graph modelling the links between drugs and diseases, the ultimate aim of the project is to analyse the distances between the nodes of the graph, obtaining a ranking capable of highlighting interesting relationships between drugs and each of the diseases of interest.
